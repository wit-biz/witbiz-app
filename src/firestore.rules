/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset establishes a strict, user-centric data ownership model.
 * It is designed for applications where data is siloed and private to each authenticated user,
 * with no collaborative or public data access.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is based on strict user ownership. All user-generated content is stored
 * within a dedicated subcollection under their unique user ID (`/users/{userId}`). Access is
 * granted only if the requesting user's authenticated UID matches the `userId` in the document path.
 * This approach ensures that users can only ever access their own information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All application data is hierarchically organized under the top-level `/users` collection.
 *   - `/users/{userId}`: Root document for a user's data.
 *   - `/users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}`: Stores a user's private contacts.
 *   - `/users/{userId}/leads/{leadId}`: Stores a user's private leads.
 *   - `/users/{userId}/leads/{leadId}/tasks/{taskId}`: Stores tasks related to a specific lead,
 *     inheriting ownership from the parent user.
