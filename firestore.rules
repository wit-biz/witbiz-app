/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for WitCRM application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has exclusive access to their leads, contacts, and tasks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that all leads, contacts, and tasks are scoped to the owning user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/leads/{leadId}
 *  - /users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}
 *  - /users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data, preventing cross-user data access.
 * - Listing operations are scoped to the user's data, preventing unauthorized data exposure.
