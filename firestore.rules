/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for WitCRM application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for leads, contacts, and tasks.
 * Each user has complete control over the data nested under their `/users/{userId}` path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is organized hierarchically under `/users/{userId}`, with subcollections for `leads`, `contacts`, and `tasks`.
 * This structure simplifies authorization, as ownership can be determined directly from the path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access data under their own user ID.
 * - Listing other users' leads, contacts or tasks is explicitly denied.
 * - Data model is flexible and does not validate the data shape. Only validates ownership on write operations.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - All authorization decisions are made based on the path, avoiding the need for costly `get()` calls to other documents.
