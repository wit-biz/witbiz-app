/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for WitCRM application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for leads, contacts, and tasks.
 * Each user has exclusive access to the data nested under their `/users/{userId}` path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is organized hierarchically under `/users/{userId}`, with subcollections for `leads`, `contacts`, and `tasks`.
 *  - /users/{userId}/leads/{leadId}
 *  - /users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}
 *  - /users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All data access is predicated on the user being authenticated (`request.auth != null`) and the requested resource existing.
 * - The rules explicitly deny any operation not specifically allowed.
 * - Flexible data shapes are allowed during this prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The user ID is encoded in the path, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to determine ownership.
