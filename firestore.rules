/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data within the WitCRM application.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/leads/{leadId}: Stores leads owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}: Stores contacts owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}: Stores tasks assigned to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete data within their own /users/{userId} data tree.
 * - Listing of user documents and subcollection documents is restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: N/A - Path-based ownership is used.
